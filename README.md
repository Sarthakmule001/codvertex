This project implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. The game is designed to be played by two players, alternating turns, with one player using 'X' and the other using 'O'. The objective is to align three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, on a 3x3 grid.

Key Features:

Player Input: The program takes input from both players, ensuring valid moves by checking if a chosen cell is unoccupied.
Board Display: The current state of the board is displayed after each move to help players keep track of their progress.
Win/Draw Detection: The game checks for winning conditions after every turn. If a player aligns three of their marks, they are declared the winner. In case all cells are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.
Replay Option: After the game ends, players have the option to restart the game and play again.
Technology Stack:

Programming Language: Python
Modules Used: Basic Python functionality (no external libraries are required).
This project is an excellent exercise for beginners to get hands-on practice with Python, loops, conditional statements, and handling user input. It can also be easily expanded to include additional features like AI-based opponent or a graphical user interface (GUI).
